# ChatOps - Chat-Triggered System Control
Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: [Current Date]

## Project Vision
Create a unified chat-based interface enabling seamless, secure, and auditable management of internal tools, starting with Slack integration and designed for multi-messenger support. Initial focus on GitHub Actions integration with extensibility for other tools (GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Coralogix, Grafana).

## Core Objectives
- Simplify operational tasks through chat commands
- Enhance visibility and auditing of actions
- Enable role-based access control
- Automate workflows triggered by chat commands
- Maintain messenger-agnostic core architecture

## Milestone 1: GitHub Actions Integration
- Slack bot implementation
- GitHub Actions workflow triggering
- Basic audit logging
- Security implementation
- Documentation for open source contribution

## Open Source Standards
- MIT License
- Comprehensive README.md
- Contributing guidelines
- Code of Conduct
- Issue and PR templates
- Semantic versioning
- Detailed API documentation

## Key Requirements

### Integration Scope
- Slack (Command & Response Hub)
- GitHub & GitHub Actions
- Jira
- Confluence
- Coralogix
- Grafana

### Critical Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: 3s response SLA
- Availability: 99.9%
- Security: OAuth, RBAC, Audit Logging
- Scalability: Microservices Architecture

## Technical Constraints
- Microservices-based architecture
- Cloud-native deployment
- REST APIs for service communication
- Containerized deployment (Kubernetes)
- Infrastructure as Code

## Success Criteria
1. All specified integrations functional and responsive
2. Meeting performance SLAs
3. Complete audit trail implementation
4. Secure authentication and authorization
5. User-friendly Slack interface

## Risk Factors
1. Integration complexity with multiple systems
2. Security token management
3. Performance across distributed systems
4. User adoption and training
5. System reliability and fault tolerance
